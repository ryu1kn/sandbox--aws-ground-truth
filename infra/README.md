# Welcome to your CDK TypeScript project

This is a blank project for CDK development with TypeScript.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

## Prerequisites

* cdk: `brew install aws-cdk`

## Build

To build this app, you need to be in this example's root folder. Then run the following:

Create resources for AWS CDK to store assets (replace `<account-id>` and `<region>`)

```sh
cdk bootstrap aws://<account-id>/<region>
```

## Deploy

```sh
cdk deploy
```

This will deploy / redeploy your Stack to your AWS Account.

After the deployment you will see the API's URL, which represents the url you can then use.

## Synthesize Cloudformation Template

To see the Cloudformation template generated by the CDK, run:

```sh
cdk synth
```

then check the output file in the "cdk.out" directory.

## Other useful commands

* `cdk ls`          list all stacks in the app
* `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
* `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
* `cdk docs`        open CDK documentation
